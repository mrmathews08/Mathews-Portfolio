Portfolio

## Description 
This is m second homework assignment, and also my future portfolio webpage. For this assignment I figured out real fast that the layout provided can easily be found online, but most of the code written does NOT include Bootstrap. So, this is what I focused on. I tried really hard to keep my CSS to a minimum (which is why the page is so bland) because I feel like CSS can take hours to figure out style and really it comes up to preference. I tired to use Bootstrap for everything and really get a grasp for the grid system and layouts. My page is fully fucntioning and while I dont have any projects yet, the images on the Portfolio page do lead to other sites. 


## Installation

Step by step, I formatted the HTML using bootstrap to make everything functional. I wanted everything to work properly about all else and for my code to stay organized. For some reason, the homepage was the hardest part for me because I am still hvaing some layout issues with the grid system. I think I accidentally put in a subrow somewhere and cant seem to figure it out. At the time of turning in the assignemnt, everything was functioning as it should. One thing that did hang me up for a bit was getting the link and sources in the right order in my head tags.

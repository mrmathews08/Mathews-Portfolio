Portfolio

## Description 
This is the second homework assignment, and also my future portfolio webpage. It includes three pages, a homepage, a portfolio page and a contact page. 
It contains my personal contact info: on the homepage is a link to my instagram. on the portfolio page, the images are links relevant to me and on the contact page is an email form that does 
not send an email to me unfortunately.  


## Installation

Step by step, I formatted the HTML using bootstrap to make everything functional. I wanted everything to work properly about all else and for my code to stay organized. For some reason, the homepage was the hardest part for me because I am still having some layout issues with the grid system. I think I accidentally put in a subrow somewhere and cant seem to figure it out. At the time of turning in the assignemnt, everything was functioning as it should. (One thing that did hang me up for a bit was getting the link and sources in the right order in my head tags.) 


## Usage
